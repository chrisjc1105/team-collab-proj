      <div class="about_me">
        Hello! My name is Mya Walker. I was born and raised in Indiana, but I
        currently live in Atlanta. I come from a background of clerical work as
        well as dance: in fact, I actually try and teach dance lessons when I
        can. I appreciate and welcome all styles of dance, as long as we can
        have fun and get some good exercise in!
        <br />
        <br />
        Personally, I love reality tv shows, romantic comedies and musicals, as
        well as watching vlog content on YouTube; it inspires me to want to solo
        travel more often.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m very passionate about family, health, and finding happiness and
        comfort in life’s small moments. I would love to expand upon my design
        skills within the Web Design field, and although I may encounter some
        learning challenges in coding, I’m a resourceful person and would love
        the chance to try my best in anything.
