# team-collab-proj

Hey there! This is a project made for Mya Walker by Christopher Camacho- we happened to be partners together on this project (and by the way, couldn't be happier! <3), and so we made simple about me pages for each other based on our interests and livelihoods. 

Once again, I will be walking you through my webpage and what you can find from top to bottom.

## Important Notes

- All of the formatting was made with some sort of CSS Flexbox code.
- This time, I tried to make the page more responsive by using the rem value instead of px. It may not be perfect since I didn't use media query BUT, I tried my best!! ðŸ¥²
- All the images I used can now be found in a single folder called "images", and they should be named appropriately.
    - Additionally, all images that pertain to Mya and her life have been submitted by her, and I was given consent to upload the images for hosting. 

## 1. Top Row - PFP, Name Logo & Quote

This is the first row on the webpage. This includes a circular edition of Mya's main headshot, a large edition of Mya's name in Italianno font, and a quote of her choice by John C. Maxwell. 

## 2. Full "About Me" Section w/ Pics

This is where I have placed both a section for Mya's about me (written by myself in Mya's "first person" based on facts that I gained from conversing with her) as well as placed images that pertain to her life and likes. 

1. The top left image is Mya herself.
2. The top right image is a photo of Atlanta.
3. The bottom left image is a photo of "Wicked" the movie. 
4. The bottom right image is a photo of Mya's wonderful schnauzer Flora (with the appropriate caption for the doggie).

## Please Enjoy!
